Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others.

      "Speech:The speech is A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's departing speech as the President of India, after completing his five-year tenure. He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences, highlighting 10 important messages that he learned during his time in office. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Utilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agricultural growth\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through determination and partnership\n",
      "6. Showing courage in the face of calamities\n",
      "7. Promoting connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "8. Defending the nation with pride\n",
      "9. Fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He begins to elaborate on the first message, \"Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth\", by sharing a story about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. He appreciated her question and assured her that it was possible with collective effort. The speech is a reflection on his time in office and a call to action for the people of India to work together towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be brought to the nation's highest institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker reflects on their experiences visiting villages, including a trip to Nagaland, where they saw the positive impact of empowering village councils and providing physical connectivity. They also highlight the initiative of the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas through a concept called PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas). This initiative has led to the creation of healthcare centers, education and vocational training centers, and has generated large-scale employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. The speaker emphasizes the need to empower villages and provide connectivity to transform the 600,000 villages of India and make the country more competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the support of self-help groups. The project has developed waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, power generation, and food processing. The project has also received technological support from a college and expertise from Japan, resulting in the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products. The speaker believes that this model can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide and suggests that 7000 similar projects are needed across the country to achieve sustainable economic development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two enriching experiences of the speaker. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first experience is about meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". The speaker is confident that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about meeting a disabled person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite his disability, Krishna Murthy is confident, happy, and thankful to those who have helped him. He doesn't ask for anything, but instead, offers to sing in front of the speaker, showcasing his positive attitude and determination to succeed despite his challenges. The speech inspires the audience to \"defeat the problems and succeed\" with confidence and a positive mindset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two inspiring stories. The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disability, has blossomed into a talented musician with the support of his parents, teachers, and others. He has even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre, showcasing his talent and inspiring others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe losses, the villagers showed remarkable courage and resilience in the face of disaster, and were able to overcome their problems with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government. The speaker praises the indomitable spirit of the people of Urusa, who have become masters of their problems rather than being defeated by them. The overall message of the speech is one of hope, perseverance, and the power of positive attitude in overcoming adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker recounts visiting a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations and interacting with them. They also mention visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where they were touched by the tribal islanders' courage and selflessness in taking care of affected victims. The speaker even composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which they sang with the villagers, showcasing their enthusiasm and courage despite their suffering. The speech also briefly mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary is cut off before further details are provided. Overall, the speech highlights the speaker's admiration for people's courage and ability to come together in times of crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a \"Pan African e-Network\" to connect 53 African countries through a seamless satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network, estimated to cost $100 million. The project aims to link:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students, and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a high-ranking official, possibly a President or Prime Minister, discussing various initiatives and experiences. The main points can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tele-consultation with Africa**: India is providing live tele-consultation services to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and plans to connect with 53 African countries through the Pan African network.\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in the Indian Armed Forces, having visited various military units, including those in Siachen Glacier and on a submarine and fighter jet. They praise the bravery and dedication of soldiers, sailors, and air warriors.\n",
      "3. **Youth movement**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech highlights India's international collaborations, its strong defense capabilities, and initiatives to empower its youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become more self-disciplined, responsible, and patriotic. The speaker shares personal anecdotes, including a story about a student who convinced her father to quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp. The speech concludes by emphasizing the need to empower India's 540 million youth through value-based education and leadership, and expresses confidence in the country's future due to the potential of its young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, thanks to its hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth. The speech highlights the need for empowering members of society and striving for a nation with:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Equitable distribution of energy and quality water\n",
      "* Harmonious cooperation between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "* Access to education with a value system for all meritorious candidates\n",
      "* A destination for top talent in various fields\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by resolving to work towards achieving these goals and becoming a developed nation by 2020, inspiring citizens to aim high and work together to reach their targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Good healthcare for all\n",
      "* Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",
      "* Elimination of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A society where everyone feels included and valued\n",
      "* Overall prosperity, health, security, peace, and happiness, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, where he:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love, cooperation, and support over the last five years\n",
      "* Shares his life's mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society and instill self-confidence\n",
      "* Reiterates his commitment to helping India become a developed nation before 2020\n",
      "* Ends with a blessing and a patriotic note, \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
